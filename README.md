# Surface scanning
It is a difficult task to take a photograph of a metal surface, there is a lot of glare.
To digitize an image of a large part, it is necessary to get rid of this shortcoming.
A plotter system was created that recorded the video.
Using a script, the desired image was created from the video.
Videos and other data are not available in the repository due to file size restrictions.
